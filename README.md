# Forecast

Forecast is a weather app that returns the weather conditions of the location that you input. 
This is done using the Dark Sky API that fetches the JSON weather data for a specific latitude and longitude values.
We obtain both the latitude and longtitude values by using the Google Maps API search box for a specific location that we want.
